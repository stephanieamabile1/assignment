<div id="Interest in IT" class="tabcontent">
  <h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">The reason why I chose to study IT in RMIT</h3>
    <img src="rmit.jpg" alt="rmit" width="400" height="300">
  <p>My mum sparked my interest in IT because my mum is currently working in IT.</br>
Hence I have been through 1 week of work experience in 2015 at her workplace. I saw there was a need of women in the workplace as it was mainly male dominant.</br> 
This was not the only reason I wanted to do IT, the main reason was that IT is part of the future and still is to this day.</br> 
IT is essential was banking, flight reservations, e-commerce websites and business, etc. In a nutshell, IT is part of every workplace in a big or small way.</br>
My interest in IT is managing IT projects or programs for a company because I have good leadership skills and good people skills to lead the team.</p> 
<p>I chose to enroll in RMIT, as it is a well-known university recognised in the innovation of IT.</br>
I have also been to the RMIT city campus during my Year 10 excursion where I saw the lecture rooms and the facilities on campus.</br>
I was amazed at how modern and clean the building was, also the location was convenient for me as there is easy access to public transport and in the heart of Melbourne.</br>
<p>I expect to learn the basics of programming such as JAVA language and using Eclipse which is a program to use JAVA language in, how to design a user-friendly product or </br>
system so that it is efficient and effective for customers or users, understand the IT project management principles, how to manage or lead a team, how to stand out from a crowd </br>
of applicants in an interview, and get a better understanding on what my future job will be like. </p>
</div>

<div id="Ideal Job" class="tabcontent">

<p>A IT Project Manager job is appealing to me, as I like to be part of a team; specifically managing the team as a leader.</br>

<p>I will obtain the skills needed for this job by learning management in year 2 and 3 of my Bachelor of IT course. I will gain qualifications, as I will work as a Junior IT Project</br

<div id="Personal Profile" class="tabcontent">
<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Learning Style Test</h3>
<p>The learning style test showed that I am more of a visual learner, hence I should use flashcards, colour coding, diagrams and key words to my advantage when memorising information.</br>
The learning style test shows that in a team, I may draw diagrams or tables to explain new concepts and I may colour code information.</br>
When forming a team, I would set up a PPT or some visual presentation as I am a visual learner based on the learning style test.</p>

<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Myer Briggs Test</h3>
<p>The Myer Briggs Test showed that I am an idealist temperament, that is I have ambitions that I aim to achieve, I like visualising the future and looking at the big picture.</br>
According to my Myer Briggs Test, in a team I may be caring towards my team and ask how their day is going etc.</br>
According to the Myer Briggs Test, I would think of who I would want in my team as I think of the future. I would also think of the kinds of tasks that I would have to complete </br> 
in the team as I like to plan ahead. I would also think about how many people would be required in my team.</p>

<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Big 5 Personality Test</h3>
<p>The Big 5 Personality Test Results stated that I am a moderately open person which means I like to play around with ideas and think creatively to an extent. It stated I am low in</br>
neurotism so I am the type of person to not get angry or lose temper all of a sudden.</br>
Based on the test for the Big 5 Personality Test, I would be friendly and energetic towards my team members and sometimes I help team members out with their needs.</br>
According to the Big 5 Personality Test, when forming a team I would be friendly to people and confront people to be part of my team. I should take into account that I am an emphateic</br>
person so I would ask my team if they needed help with anything.</p>

<div id="Project Idea" class="tabcontent">
    <h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Overview</h3>
<p>My Project Idea is to create an app called MovieBinge which would essentially have a list of different movies e.g. Romance, Comedy, Thriller, etc.; and in each category there would </br>
be a description of the films, rating based on customers who used the app, actors description and films that are similar to watch. The app would also allow the users to view the films </br>
and users would not have to pay for the app, as it is free. However there will ads displayed before the actual movie plays, which the creator will accumulate income from. </p>

<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Motivation</h3>
<p>I was inspired to create this project as often I would search on Google Romantic movies to watch however there was no website that had a list of movie categories.</br>
My MovieBinge app would be useful to users as there would be movie recommendations that are based on what kind of movies you like to watch. </br>
It is also a quick and efficient app where users can watch movies of all time such as movies from the early 2000s to even movies that have been released recently.</p>

<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Description</h3>
<p>The app would have IOS and Android. The app would allow the user to rewind or fast-forward the movie. The app would have high-definition video streaming experience. </br>
The app would be available for both WIFI and 3G networks. The app would allow users to touch or click the emoji button (e.g. love heart, crying, laugh, and angry) </br>
where the app will store what kinds of movie genre you like, love or cry over. </br>
The emoji button will also be displayed on the movie critic section where it shows how many people loved the movie, hated the movie, cried over the movie and laughed </br>
their heads off. The app would feature the role of the actors in the film, the duration of the movie, popular movies on MovieBinge, movies similar to what you like to watch, </br>
and new movies. The app would allow the user to view the movie full screen.</p>

<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Tools & Technologies</h3>
<p>I would need to develop this app on IOS and Android. I would need to understand the programming language, Swift and Java. I would need to understand how to handle user interface and how to respond to user interface.</p>

<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Skills required</h3>
<p>I would need skills in programming language, Swift and Java. This will be helpful so I can run my app in IOS and Android. It will be feasible to find the skills in those languages by practicing on IDE.</p>

<h3 style="color:DarkTurquoise;">Outcome</h3>
<p>If this project were to be successful, the outcome would be that users would be able to stream their movies on laptops, tablets and smartphones. It would be the users ultimate go-to app when they want to chill and watch a movie. </p>
